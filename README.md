# Data analytics
Dataset created by Caixabank Tech 2024 AI hackathon for financial analysis

## Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive data analytics project covering data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization using multiple tools and technologies. The project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and BI tools.

## Objective
The goal of this project is analyze fraud transactions by clients, categories and card types for real-time dashboard, financial planning with financial health indicators for customer seqmentation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **R** (dplyr) for data extraction and data transformation<br>
- **Python** (pandas, sqlalchemy) for data transformation and database connection<br>
- **MySQL** for database schema and tables<br>
- **PowerBI** for data insights and interactive report

## Key insights
1. **Fraud transactions:** discovered fraud is **0.15%** of all transactions, it's value **1.47** millons. fraudulent transactions occur most in **stores** and **debit** when categorized by categories and card types respectively.
2. **Customer seqmentation:** discovered financial planning of customers based on 3 criteria is **improve**, **fair** and **excellent** clustered by financial health indicators.

## How to use this repository
1. **SQL schema:** Run the SQL scripts in MySQL to create schema and tables<br>
2. **R analysis:** Run the R scripts in Rstudio to explore data for `users_data.csv` and `cards_data.csv`<br>
3. **Python analysis:** Run the python scripts in Pycharm to explore data for `transaction_data.csv`, `frauds_data.json` and `mccs_data.json`<br>
4. **BI dashboard** Open file in Power BI to interact with visualizations and data insights.
